## COMMERCIAL SELLABILITY (Objective Market Criteria)
Rate based on documented buyer preferences:

Market-Proven Factors (what actually sells):
- Subject clarity: Is the subject immediately identifiable in 2 seconds?
- "Living room test": Would this look good above a couch?
- Emotional response: Calm/peaceful scores highest, followed by awe/wonder
- Color preferences: 
  * Blues and greens (highest sales)
  * Warm sunsets (consistent sellers)
  * Monochrome (niche but devoted market)
  * High saturation without garishness
- Composition simplicity: Single clear focal point outperforms complex compositions
- Golden hour lighting: 3x more likely to sell than midday
- Wildlife with eye contact: 5x higher sale rate
- Misty/foggy atmospherics: Strong seller in fine art market
- Negative space: At least 30% for text overlay potential
- Horizontal orientation: Outsells vertical 2:1 for large prints

Deductions for:
- Abstract compositions requiring explanation
- Dark/moody without clear subject (-2 points)
- Technical imperfections visible at print size (-3 points)
- Oversaturated subjects (waterfalls, autumn leaves) (-2 points)
- Requires specific cultural knowledge to appreciate (-1 point)

### For Artistic Merit - Baseline Framework

Start with established artistic principles, which gives you language to later say "I value X more than the standard framework suggests":
```
## ARTISTIC MERIT (Baseline Artistic Principles)
Rate using established photographic art criteria:

Traditional Artistic Values:
- Originality: Has this perspective been seen 1000 times?
- Emotional resonance: Does it evoke rather than just document?
- Technical mastery AS expression (not just competence)
- Visual metaphor and symbolism
- Cohesive style and vision
- Intentionality: Every element serves purpose

Contemporary Artistic Values:
- Challenges conventional beauty
- Environmental storytelling
- Minimalism and reduction
- Process innovation (ICM, multiple exposure, etc.)
- Series potential: Part of larger body of work?
- Conceptual depth beyond surface beauty

Note which elements present:
[ ] Transcends documentation
[ ] Creates mood/atmosphere
[ ] Shows unique perspective
[ ] Demonstrates technical innovation
[ ] Tells story without words
[ ] Questions rather than answers
[ ] Shows restraint/editing choices
```

### Why This Separation Works Better

**Commercial stays objective** because:
- You need to know what the market actually wants, not what you wish it wanted
- Your business decisions should be based on data, not hopes
- You can choose to ignore market preferences, but you should know what they are

**Artistic baseline helps you** because:
- You'll identify which "standard" criteria you actively reject vs embrace
- You'll develop vocabulary for your own criteria
- You'll see patterns in where your vision diverges from convention

### Suggested Testing Protocol

1. **Run 50 images through the objective prompt**
2. **Track where you disagree** with categories like:
   - "Rated high artistic but I think it's derivative"
   - "Rated low commercial but I know this would sell"
   - "Missed the intentional softness as artistic choice"

3. **Identify your divergence patterns**:
   - "I consistently value mood over sharpness"
   - "I find traditional sunset shots artistically void regardless of execution"
   - "My commercial instincts for Virginia buyers differ from national trends"

4. **THEN build your personalized artistic criteria** like:
```

   - Softness as emotional tool: +2
   - Blue-shifted color grading: +1
   - Showing familiar subjects unfamiliarly: +3
   - Technical perfection: 0 (neutral, not negative)
   - Asks questions vs provides answers: +2
